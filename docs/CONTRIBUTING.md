### Welcome!

We’re glad to see you are interested in contributing. We hope to build a community around developing this project and helping as many people as possible.

The following are guidelines that we feel will nudge developers toward correct choices while making contributions.
Feel free to point out anything that could be improved/changed in a pull request.

<br></br>

### How to Contribute

To contribute, please issue a pull request using the following procedure:

1. Make sure that any install or build dependencies are removed before the layer end while doing a build.

2. Update the README.md with the appropriate changes to the interface, such as a change in the environment variables, an update in version number. Also, update navigation changes such as file location changes and dependency changes to the readme.

3. Make sure to document any changes/additions you make to packages or libraries that need to be installed, since all of the commands to install new packages have to be run any time a new server instance is created.

4. Update the version number and relevant code in demonstration/example files and in README.md to the new version.

5. Ensure that all of the test cases are passed before merging the pull request.

6. We request that you allow complete access to all developers, but take the optional approval of all of the developers before merging the pull request to minimize any unexpected bugs. This also works well with the Linux best practices principle of zero internal boundaries.

<br></br>

### Some other things to consider when merging a pull request

- Be clear with the exact problem that you’re trying to solve/feature you’re trying to add. You can refer to our defined objectives for what we would do ourselves should we have had to carry this project into phase 3.

- Ensure that it is of good quality. The language should be clear and concise without any spelling or grammar mistakes.

- Make sure that any contribution of any sort follows the code of conduct. Our repository has a [code of conduct](https://github.com/PvPatel-1001/Recipe_Recommender/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and any pull request that does not respect these will be appropriately removed.

<br></br>

### Where to Contribute

You can contribute in the following ways to our code:

- Start a discussion

  - Discuss any part of the code that you would like to talk about with a developer or fellow contributor. You can request previous phase developers for information on particular design or programming decisions or to help with any issues.

- Add to the README

  - Add to the existing description of the layout of the repository. You can add a new section or improve an existing one. You're always welcome to add demos for particular functions as well!

- Point out bugs

  - Point out any bugs that you notice while running our project. We request that you be specific to the best of your ability. You can also include steps to debug as objectives for the next phase!

- Pull Requests

  - A pull request allows you to suggest changes to the code and lets you add in new stuff or change some of the older code in a branch.

- Open an issue
  - If you see any visible problems/areas that you consider being an issue, open an issue and one of the developers will connect with you to discuss it in further detail.

<br></br>

### Setting up a development environment

You can do this in 2 ways:

1. Install Node JS for your device:

- Windows/MacOS/Linux:
  - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Clone the repository to your device.

3. Install required packages in the front end folder by running npm install in the frontend folder.

4. Login to firebase using 'firebase login'
   
5. Deploy firebase functions using 'firebase deploy'

6. Type in "npm start" in the frontend folder and press enter.

###OR

1. Run an AWS EC2 instance

2. Install Node JS on the machine

3. Clone the repository to root and run npm start.

## How you can contribute and not break the system:

1. Do NOT commit a code that isn't working on your local machine.
2. Do NOT copy code from proprietary sources that require a license to reuse their code.
3. Do NOT use someone else's code and credit it to your own name.
4. Do NOT discourage other contributors. Keep updating the issues section in case you feel something is broken or can be enhanced.

Cheers! We look forward to collaborating with you.

**You’re all set!**
