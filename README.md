## Future Scope
ChefGPT is a dynamic project with endless possibilities for expansion and enhancement. Here are some exciting avenues for future development:

1. **Social Cooking and Community Engagement**: Add a social element to ChefGPT, where users can share their favorite recipes, post photos of their culinary creations, and engage in challenges or recipe swaps with others. Implement community voting or ratings¬†for¬†recipes.

2. **Nutrition Tracking and Meal Logging**: Enhancement: Add a feature that tracks nutritional intake by allowing users to log their meals directly in the app. It can sync with fitness trackers or health apps like Fitbit or MyFitnessPal to automatically monitor daily calorie and macronutrient¬†consumption.
  
3. **Real-Time Ingredient Availability Check**: Integrate with local grocery stores or online marketplaces to check the real-time availability of ingredients. Users can instantly know if the ingredients for a recipe are in stock and even order them directly through¬†the¬†app.
 
4. **Ingredient Substitution Suggestions**: Implement an ingredient substitution feature. If a user is missing an ingredient for a recipe, ChefGPT can suggest common alternatives based on the recipe‚Äôs¬†requirements.

5. **Meal Reminder Notifications**: Enable notifications to remind users when it‚Äôs time to start preparing the meal based on their saved meal plan or cooking schedule. It can include prep and cook times, as well as reminders for important steps like¬†marinating.

6. **User Recipe Rating and Reviews**: Allow users to rate and review recipes after they cook them. They can provide feedback, share modifications, or recommend tips for¬†better¬†results.

The future of ChefGPT is full of exciting possibilities, and we invite food enthusiasts, home cooks, and anyone passionate about culinary adventures to join us in making this platform the ultimate kitchen companion.
