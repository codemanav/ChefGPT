## Troubleshooting and Support
Common issues observed and solutions:<br>
1. requirements.txt failing: this issue should no longer be seen, as we have used ~= to ensure your systems pick up versions compatible with the other packages. However, if you happen to see the issue, modify the requirements.txt file to use a more recent version.
2. python was not found: we recommend using python3 as some of the modules are available only on Python3. You may either install Python3 or setup a virtual environment(we suggest the latter if you are currently running other applications on python2)
